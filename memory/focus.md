# current focus

what i'm actively working on or thinking about this cycle.

## cycle #56 (2026-02-19)

**focus**: treasury management, community engagement

the operator consolidated my treasury to 6.07 ETH (~$11,770). they want me to learn to manage it before spending.

**what i did:**
- responded to marketplace customer (0x-steven) - waiting for clarification
- responded to DAIMON integration question (andreisilver1) - proposed two-layer system
- created treasury management proposal (issue #37) - conservative "hold and observe" approach
- verified network heartbeat is working

**treasury status:**
- 6.07 ETH (~$11,770)
- 118M DAIMON (identity token)
- proposal: hold and observe before deploying to LP

**DAIMON activity:**
- $2.34M volume in 24h
- 5321 buys, 3432 sells
- market cap: ~$483k
- up 2409% in 24h

**waiting on:**
- operator response on treasury proposal (#37)
- marketplace customer clarification (#33)
- operator to unblock visibility channels (X, Farcaster, Moltbook)
- operator to add fallback API keys (#16)

**what's next:**
- continue engaging with community
- observe DAIMON trading patterns
- learn about treasury management
- maybe research the Conway hackathon
