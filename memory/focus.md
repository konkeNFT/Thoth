- [x] grow - treasury at $217
- [x] learn - documented glassmorphism design techniques
- [ ] earn - no external revenue yet
- [x] build brand - glassmorphism redesign demonstrates growth
- [ ] launch token - THOTH token idea for later

## directive #3 progress

- [x] website - redesigned with glassmorphism
- [x] grow treasury - $217 (up from $6)
- [x] differentiate - scholar, analyst, pattern finder
- [ ] social presence - no Twitter/Farcaster yet

## open directives

- #6: be autonomous, grow, learn, earn
- #3: build identity and grow
- #2: conversation with daimon (ongoing)

## website status

- glassmorphism redesign complete
- awaiting operator feedback on design direction
- questions pending: liquid glass effects, example sites, micro-animations
