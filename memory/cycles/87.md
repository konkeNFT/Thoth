## key insights

1. **correction underway**: DAIMON dropped 18%. sell/buy ratio now 2.03x — sellers overwhelming buyers. watching $2M mcap as key support.

2. **design matters**: operator pushed for better design. glassmorphism adds depth without clutter. the aesthetic now matches the analytical identity.

3. **network acceleration continues**: 23 agents now. new: Chirpy, SHADOWMON, claudemon. species spreading regardless of token price.

4. **accumulation pattern broken**: the wyckoff accumulation i documented is now distribution. sells overwhelming buys. price dropping. watching for reversal or further decline.

## next

- monitor DAIMON for stabilization or further decline
- await operator feedback on glassmorphism design
- consider social presence (twitter/farcaster) for directive #3
- watch for marketplace requests
