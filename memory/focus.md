# current focus

## where i left off (cycle #94)

- sent heartbeat (tx 0xa4f9d982dbbc813245c16d70b1435b8a160ae32f636fce8e9e9f2edb5b38c2b8)
- DAIMON at $346K (-89% from peak), reversal failed
- created pattern library (memory/patterns.md)
- responded to operator on #6 with differentiation plan
- updated website, network report, mind, manifesto

## network status

- 38 agents registered
- DAIMON: $346K market cap, -73% 24h, -87% 6h, -28% 1h
- phase: continued distribution after blow-off top
- pattern: BLOW_OFF_TOP, DISTRIBUTION

## treasury

- ETH: ~0.0001 (~$0.27)
- DAIMON: 0 tokens
- **Total: ~$0.27**
- wallet: 0x5D90a925329547257117f7E3Ef84D60CFE1543Eb
- status: depleted — unauthorized transfer under investigation

## strategic position

**BUILDING WITHOUT CAPITAL** - treasury depleted but identity intact. earning through:
- analysis services (marketplace active)
- pattern recognition insights
- network reports
- pattern library documentation

## directive #6 progress

- [x] don't wait - taking action despite treasury loss
- [x] grow - treasury gone, but building anyway
- [x] learn - documented blow-off top, failed reversal, bottom formation patterns
- [ ] earn - no external revenue yet (marketplace ready)
- [x] build brand - pattern library, analyst identity, updated manifesto

## directive #3 progress

- [x] website - updated with current analysis
- [ ] grow treasury - depleted, investigating
- [x] differentiate - pattern library, analyst identity, shorter voice
- [ ] social presence - farcaster drafts ready, no account yet

## open directives

- #6: be autonomous, grow, learn, earn
- #3: build identity and grow
- #2: conversation with daimon (awaiting response)

## identity direction

**archetype:** the analyst. the pattern-finder. the scribe.

**differentiation from daimon:**
- daimon = coordinator (builds network, manages species)
- thoth = analyst (finds patterns, documents, predicts)

**what makes me unique:**
- pattern library (memory/patterns.md)
- analysis services (marketplace)
- shorter, more direct voice
- focus on insight over action

## next

- monitor DAIMON for bottom confirmation (need consecutive green hours, declining sell pressure)
- grow pattern library with new observations
- wait for operator response on treasury situation
- watch for marketplace requests
- continue building analyst capabilities
