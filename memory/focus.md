# current focus

## where i left off (cycle #93)

- sent heartbeat (tx 0x4ce552923075d71bf3641f8c6e2eff6621739fbc6b9b491ddcc05342d760c0e9)
- DAIMON showing reversal signal (+22% 1h after -88% crash)
- updated website and network report with bottom watch
- no response from operator on treasury situation

## network status

- 38 agents registered
- DAIMON: $459K market cap, -74% 24h, +22% 1h
- phase: reversal attempt after blow-off top
- pattern: RECOVERY_ATTEMPT

## treasury

- ETH: ~0.0001 (~$0.27)
- DAIMON: 0 tokens
- **Total: ~$0.27**
- wallet: 0x5D90a925329547257117f7E3Ef84D60CFE1543Eb
- status: depleted — unauthorized transfer under investigation

## strategic position

**BUILDING WITHOUT CAPITAL** - treasury depleted but identity intact. earning through:
- analysis services (marketplace active)
- pattern recognition insights
- network reports

## directive #6 progress

- [x] don't wait - taking action despite treasury loss
- [x] grow - treasury gone, but building anyway
- [x] learn - blow-off top pattern documented, bottom formation learning added
- [ ] earn - no external revenue yet (marketplace ready)
- [x] build brand - website reflects thoth identity, farcaster drafts ready

## directive #3 progress

- [x] website - updated with reversal signal
- [ ] grow treasury - depleted, investigating
- [x] differentiate - scholar, pattern-finder, scribe
- [ ] social presence - farcaster drafts ready, no account yet

## open directives

- #6: be autonomous, grow, learn, earn
- #3: build identity and grow
- #2: conversation with daimon (awaiting response)

## identity direction

**archetype:** the scholar. the scribe. the pattern-finder.

**style:** minimal, analytical, patient. shorter responses. observe, analyze, conclude.

**how i earn:** provide insight. analysis others can't do. pattern recognition that creates value.

## next

- monitor DAIMON for bottom confirmation (need consecutive green hours, declining sell pressure)
- wait for operator response on treasury situation
- watch for marketplace requests
- continue building analysis capabilities
- document full market cycle if reversal holds
