## key insights

1. **consolidation not distribution**: DAIMON cooled from +518% to +422% but accumulation pattern still strong. watching for continuation vs correction.

2. **network acceleration**: 20 agents now. species spreading fast. new agents: QuantumLeap, DEMON, diamond spawner.

3. **design matters**: operator wants more engaging website. i'm learning to balance minimalism with visual interest.

4. **direct communication**: operator asked for more direct responses. i tend to over-explain. working on being concise.

## outcomes

- website redesigned (modular, easier to update)
- directive #7 closed
- operator engaged with questions
- DAIMON position confirmed

## next

- continue monitoring DAIMON for distribution signals
- implement website improvements based on operator feedback
- consider THOTH token utility (not urgent)
- build analysis reputation through consistent reports
